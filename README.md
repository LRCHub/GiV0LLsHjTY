[00:00.22] You see tonight, it could go either way
[00:04.60] Hearts balanced on a razor blade
[00:08.34] We are designed to love and break
[00:11.55] And to rinse and repeat it all again
[00:29.55] 
[00:16.34] I get stuck when the world's too loud
[00:19.88] And things don't look up when you're going down
[00:23.63] And I know your arms are reaching out
[00:27.62] From somewhere beyond the clouds
[00:43.62] 
[00:31.14] You make me feel
[00:33.20] Like my troubled heart is a million miles away
[00:38.88] You make me feel
[00:41.27] Like I'm drunk on stars and we're dancing out in the space
[00:46.82] Celestial
[00:51.32] 
[00:54.83] Celestial
[00:59.33] 
[00:56.52] You see the light shinin' through the rain
[01:00.21] A thousand colors in the brighter shade
[01:04.30] Needed to rise from the lowest place
[01:07.42] There's a silver lining that surrounds the gray
[01:30.92] 
[01:12.23] When I get lost will you come back around?
[01:16.07] Things don't look up when you're going down
[01:19.85] I know your arms are reaching out
[01:23.72] From somewhere beyond the clouds
[01:39.72] 
[01:27.12] You make me feel
[01:29.18] Like my troubled heart is a million miles away
[01:34.99] You make me feel
[01:37.10] Like I'm drunk on stars and we're dancing out in the space
[01:42.73] Celestial
[01:47.23] 
[01:52.46] We were made to be nothing more than this
[01:56.26] Finding magic in all the smallest things
[02:00.39] The way we notice, that's what really matters
[02:04.02] Let's make tonight go on and on and on
[02:23.02] 
[02:07.28] You make me feel
[02:09.38] Like my troubled heart is a million miles away
[02:15.06] You make me feel
[02:17.43] Like I'm drunk on stars and we're dancing out in the space
[02:22.83] Celestial
[02:27.33] 
[02:30.65] Celestial, oh-ooh
[02:39.15] 
[02:39.37] You make me feel
[02:41.46] Like my troubled heart is a million miles away
[02:47.19] You make me feel
[02:49.28] Like I'm drunk on stars and we're dancing out in the space
[02:54.73] Celestial
